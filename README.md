# Exercising Kemal
Running through some Kemal exercises.

## The Skinny
Kemal is a Sinatra-like framework written in [Crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) (a very fast, compiled, ruby-like language).
This is truly a dream come true! It is truly hard to continue doing Go right now ;-)

## Installation
See instructions here http://kemalcr.com/docs/getting_started/
